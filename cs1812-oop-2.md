# Enumerated Types and Recursion

## Enums

Enums are a nice way to define a set of constants within an abstract concept
e.g. days of the week, all possible suits in a deck of cards, dog breeds etc.
They can help reduce programmer mistakes and collect all types into their own
namespace.

### How do tho

You can define an enum like this

```java
public enum Day {
  MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}
```

It is typically good convention to use all capital letters in your enum member
names.

### Additional Info

-   Enums are still java classes! You can still write `toString()` methods and
    other class methods in your enum.
-   You can define constructors for your enums

#### Butilins

-   `values()` returns array of all type members
-   `valueOf(String s)` returns type with name s
-   `name()` returns name of type
-   `ordinal()` returns int corresponding to the type member

### Example of enum class with `toString` and custom constructor

```java
public enum Car {
  BMW("sport series", "CHA1 A24");
  SOKDA("5-door family car", "SK18 3XM");

  private String _desc;
  private String _reg;

  Private Car(String desc, String reg){
	this._desc = desc;
	this._reg = reg;
  }

  public toString(){
	return String.format("%s - %s", this._reg, this._desc);
  }
}
```

## Recursion

</div>

Recursion is more of a conceptual topic then a enums are. But what is recursion?
Recursive functions consist of a call to itself inside the function code, and a
base case provides logic that will make sure that the function does not infinitely
call itself.

### Example of recursive function

```java
static int factorial(int n){
  // base case
  if (n == 1)
	return 1;
  else
	return n * fact(n-1); // recursive call to itself 
}
```
Any recursive function can also be implemented using an iterative vise-versa

# Recursive Data, Exceptions

## Recusrive Data Structures
Recursive Data structures are when the signature of the data structure contains
a reference to itself. An example of this would be a linked list data structure

```java
class LinkedNode{
  LinkedNode next; // The reference to itself
  String content;
}
```

## Exceptions
We can use exceptions to deal with runtime errors or user input based issues,
you can surround the potential problematic code with `try` and `catch` blocks
the `try` section contains the code you want to try and run. In the `catch`
block you can specify the error that you want to except e.g.
`FileNotFoundException` or `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. The code following
describes what the program should do if one of these exceptions is thrown.
There is a third, optional, block you can use called `finally`. This section of
code runs no matter if an exception is thrown and should be used to do any
cleanup needed from the code ran

### Example of an Exception

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
  int[] arr = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5,6};
  Random r = new Random();
  int c = 0;
  while(c<10){
	try {
	  System.out.println(arr[r.nextInt(arr.length * 2)]);	
	  c++;
	}
	catch(IndexOutOfBoundsException e){
	  System.out.println("Exception thrown"); 
	}
  }
}
```

# I/O Streams, Stacks and Queues

## I/O Streams

A stream is a sequence of data made available over time. Both input and output
streams exist in java and they include:

- user typing in/outputting to a terminal
- writing to/reading a file
- receiving/sending data over a network

### Buffers

Instead of sending data all at once (like typical streams), we can chunk data
into small chunks and send those at different times. This will reduce the effect
that sending data all at once would have on a device. Java (being java) provides
inbuilt clases for these methods!

- [BufferedReader](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html)
- [BufferedWriter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedWriter.html)

(remember to read about the `flush` method!)

## Stacks and Queues

Stacks and Queues are two different ways of modeling data. They govern the ways
that data is added/removed to and from a list. The way they work is similar to
how the words are used in the real world. With a queue being new data is added to
the end and data is removed from the start. And a stack being data is
removed/added from the largest index.
