# Java Summary Term 2

- I'll be assuming that you have some basic knowledge of java in this doc, if
  not [click here](cs1812-oop-1.md)

- You might notice that the structure of the doc doesn't line up to the course
  structure. That's cause I *pushes up glasses*, a first year undergrad student
  happened to disagree with the structure at places. So i moved some stuff
  around!

# Enumerated Types and Recursion

## Enums
Enums are a nice way to define a set of constants within an abstract concept
e.g. days of the week, all possible suits in a deck of cards, dog breeds etc.
They can help reduce programmer mistakes and collect all types into their own
namespace.

### How do tho

You can define an enum like this

```java
public enum Day {
  MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}
```
It is typically good convention to use all capital letters in your enum member
names.

### Additional Info
- Enums are still java classes! You can still write `toString()` methods and other
class methods in your enum.
- You can define constructors for your enums 

#### Butilins
- `values()` returns array of all type members
- `valueOf(String s)` returns type with name s
- `name()` returns name of type
- `ordinal()` returns int corresponding to the type member
 
### Example of enum class with `toString` and custom constructor
```java
public enum Car {
  BMW("sport series", "CHA1 A24");
  SOKDA("5-door family car", "SK18 3XM");

  private String _desc;
  private String _reg;

  Private Car(String desc, String reg){
	this._desc = desc;
	this._reg = reg;
  }

  public toString(){
	return String.format("%s - %s", this._reg, this._desc);
  }
}
```

## Recursion
![its turtles all the way down](https://i.redd.it/knuisij959c51.jpg)
Recursion is more of a conceptual topic then a enums are. But what is recursion?
